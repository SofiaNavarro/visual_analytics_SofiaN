First you need to build the virtual environment ass1 by running create_visual_venv.sh. You do this by opening a terminal and making sure you have cd into the 'Assignment 1' folder, then write:

./create_visual_venv.sh

If this does not work, or you get "permission denied" try:

chmod +x create_visual_venv.sh

This bash script should now have upgraded to the latest version of pip as well as installed the packages from the requirements.txt. Furhtermore, the bash script also creates a folder in the visual_data folder called A1_output.

Make sure you are still in the 'Assignment 1' folder, and activate the virtual environment by typing:

source ass1/bin/activate

After activating the virtual environment, run the main script by typing:

python 1A_basic_image_processing.py

The script should only take a few seconds to run, and the output can be found in the folder A1_output.
