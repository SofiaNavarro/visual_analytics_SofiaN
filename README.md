# visual_analytics_SofiaN
Weekly assignments for visual analytics


Feel free to clone the repository so 
you have the necessary files, in this case the folder containing the images,
at your disposal to be able to run my code.

You should be able to download the .ipynb notebook and upload it to the 
jupyter workspace under visual analytics and open it as a cv101 notebook.
Also upload the image folder assOne_images in the "data" folder in the visual analytics jupyter workspace.
