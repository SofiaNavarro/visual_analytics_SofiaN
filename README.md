## visual_analytics_SofiaN
This repository contains the three class assignments chosen for the portfolio. The self chosen project resides in another repository.

###### In each 'Assignment' folders you will find:

- A README.md file explaining how to set up the virtual environment as well as how to run the script
- A bash script that creates the virtual environment
- The main .py script
- Requirements file
- A utils file containing necessary tools for two of the assignments


The visual_data folder contains the data used for each assignment, labelled according to assignment number, i.e. "A12", "A2" etc. The output folders for each of the assignments will also be created in the visual_data folder after running the bash script.
