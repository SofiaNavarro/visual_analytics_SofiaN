# visual_analytics_SofiaN
This repository contains the three class assignments chosen for the portfolio. The self chosen project resides in another repository.

The visual_data folder contains the data used for each assignment. Each data folder is labelled with an assignment code. I.e.: the datafolder pertaining to the first assignment is labelled "A1_<something>". In here are also the output folders in which the output results of each script will appear.

In each 'Assignment' folder you will find:

- A README.md file explaining how to set up the virtual environment as well as how to run the script
- A bash script that creates the virtual environment
- The main .py script
- Requirements file
- A utils file containing necessary tools for two of the assignments
